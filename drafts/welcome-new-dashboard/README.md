Sorry for the delay with news about Cogery. We have been done a big internal work which helps us to move forward faster.

Today we want to share with you a new refactored and rethinked dashboard.

The major feature is the filters. Filters can be specified by value in search input or by buttons.

Buttons in this case work just as helpers which modify the final value of search input. It like JavaScript for webpages: JavaScript enhances the UX of website but website should work without it.

Such “filers pattern”, of course, is not our know-how and it is not something new. It is widely used in many popular products such as Jira from Atlassian.

Our version of this “pattern” is inspired by Github. It is simple and powerful. We use them everyday. That why we decide that such filters must be in Cogery.

Today we introduce only a couple of filters which make it possible to replace the old dashboard.

We believe that the new dashboard is a base for future improvements for searching and filtering your reviews.
